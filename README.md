# (1st Year My Last Project)

This project steps:
First Step ==> Enter your directory
Second Step ==> Control the last line for how much match

This program protocol is SHA-256 Hashing protocol.

# PROGRAM PROCEDURE

2) Adds names to linked list
3) These names are hashes with the SHA-256 Algorithm
4) These hashes entry adds to nodes
